<!--
    THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INNERTEXT AND TEXTCONTENT AND INNERHTML
    
    innerText will show you only the visible text

    textContent will show you all the content

    innerHtml will show you the html tag if you have written in it
-->

<!-- 
    what are query selectors these are just the html tags we want the whole html tag with it 
    all attributes and like classes and id

    and querySelector and querySelectorAll 

    querySelector - will show you the first html tag

    querySelectorAll - will give you all the tags that you have selected

-->

<!-- 
   getElementById - will give you by id

   getElementByClass- will give you by class

   getElementByClassName - will give you by class name
   and it gives HTMLCollection in return

-->

<!--
    1.innerHTML: returns all html nodes 
    2.textContent : returns all text content
    3.innerText : gives the text in the selected node
    4.querySelector
    5.querySelectorAll
    6.getAttribute
    7.setAttribute
-->

<!--
    The main difference between an HTMLCollection and a NodeList is that one is live and one is static.
    This means that when an element is appended to the DOM,
    a live node will recognize the new element while a static node will not.

    The element methods getElementsByClassName() and getElementsByTagName() return a live HTMLCollection.
    It only includes the matching elements 
    (e.g. class name or tag name) and does not include text nodes, it provides only two methods item and namedItem.

    NodeLists have a defined forEach method as well as a few other methods including item, entries, keys, and values.
    NodeLists behave differently depending on how you access them; if you access elements using childNodes, 
    the returned list is live and will update as more elements are added to the node. If itâ€™s accessed using querySelectorAll(), 
    the returned list is static and will not update if more elements are added to the node.
